# Excercises
## 1. Polynomial Derivative: 
Allows the user to enter a polynomial in standard form as a string and derive its derivative.
## 2. Ecosystem Simulator:
Imitate an ecosystem of fish and bear. In each time step, based on a random process, each animal either attempts to move into an adjacent list location or stay where it is. \\
\\
If two animals of the same type are about to collide in the same cell, then they stay where they are, but they create a new instance of that type of animal, which is placed in a random empty (i.e., previously None) location in the list. If a bear and a fish collide, however, then the fish dies (i.e., it disappears).
