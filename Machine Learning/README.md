# Machine Learning
This part of the repository stores some machine learning projects. Here are some explanations.
## 1. Differential Expressed Gene Selection
**Key Techniques:** *LIMMA, edgeR, DESeq2, PEAP, LASSO, GBM, Dimension Reduction, Confusion Matrix, Multi-class classification, R*  
Implement traditional differential expressed gene selection methods and the innovative method of PEAP. Implement LASSO to do dimension reduction and GBM to conduct Multi-class classification.
## 2. Modified KNN Collaborative Filtering
**Key Techniques:** *KNN, Collaborative Filtering, Recommendation, Similarity Measure, Python*  
Modify source code of KNN Collaborative Filtering package to do course-grained recommendation preprocessing.
