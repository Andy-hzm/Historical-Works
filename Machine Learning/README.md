# Machine Learning
This part of the repository stores some machine learning projects. Here are some explanations.
## 1. Differential Expressed Gene Selection
**Key Techniques:** *LIMMA, edgeR, DESeq2, LASSO, GBM, Dimension Reduction, R*    
  
Implement traditional differential expressed gene selection methods and the innovative method of PEAP. Implement LASSO to do dimension reduction and GBM to conduct Multi-class classification.
## 2. Modified KNN Collaborative Filtering
**Key Techniques:** *KNN, Collaborative Filtering, Recommendation, Python*  
  
Modify source code of KNN Collaborative Filtering package to do course-grained recommendation preprocessing.

## 3. Kmeans and GMM implementation
**Key Techniques:** *K-means, GMM, Clustering, Python*  
  
Implement 2 clustering algorithms: K-means and Gaussian Mixture Model.
